> I wanna talk about the program "COVID-19_Analyzation" and how I'm making progress in coding.


### The beginning
When the Corona Virus started first, I didn't think it will be getting a huge problem,
which could affect people all over the world.
Then when the pandemia hit the place where I live, things gone fast and like from one moment
to another everything has changed. Not doing sports outside anymore, or just going out and
strolling through the cities.

[...]

After some time I saw that there was quite a lot of datasets so I thought why not starting
programming something around that which could eventually help others. Even I'm not experienced 
at all at this field of coding, I did my best and after some days I was quite happy with my
results. You can see them in my github repositories or see examples in the <em>Presentations</em>
section on this site.
